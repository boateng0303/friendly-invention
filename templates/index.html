        <h2>Weight vs Height of Players (Sorted)</h2>
        <p>This scatter plot shows the relationship between players' heights (in inches) and weights (in pounds), sorted by height. The trend indicates that as height increases, weight generally follows a proportional increase. Players around 70 inches (5 feet 10 inches) typically weigh under 200 lbs, while taller players exceeding 84 inches (7 feet) weigh upwards of 250 lbs. The data reflects the physical build of basketball players, where greater height usually corresponds to higher weight due to the athletic and muscular requirements of the sport.</p>
